                My name is Jay Ferrier. I have recently graduated from Nottingham Trent University after 3 years completing 

                my BSc(Hons) Computer Science course. I specialise in software development and engineering, as well as Artificial Intelligence 

                with interests mostly in different forms of Pose Estimation which was also the area that my Final Year Project/Dissertation focused on.<br><br> 

                I have always had a passion for computer science and programming since primary school, when I attended computing lessons for children, and I attained an OCR 

                Level 2 Diploma in IT skills at a young age. This lead on to me completing my GCSE Computer Science outside of school in my own time and cost due to the course 

                being removed at my school. Then I completed my A levels in Computer Science too and finally completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.<br><br>             </p>

            <p>
                Since a young age, video games have been one of my favourite hobbies.
                This interest eventually led me to Computer Science to learn how to make my own games.
                This resulted in me learning how to code in different languages and areas and eventually to persuing programming
                and computer science for my education.<br><br>
                My personal favourite genres have always been open world and adventure style games such
                as Red Dead Redemption 2 and No Man Sky and my favourite, the Soulsbourne genre including Dark Souls 1 to 3 and Elden Ring.<br><br>
                As seen in the image, I have also had an interest in more earlier examples of Video games including Arcade games such as
                Pacman, Centipede and Mario.

            <p>
                One of my interests is Formula 1 that I gained interest in thanks to a flatmate watching it often around me.
                As shown in the picture my favourite team is Mercedes and their three drivers, George Russel, Kimi Antonelli, and Valtteri Bottas.
                This is my first year watching since Imola, with my favourite track and race this year being Silverstone, with a dream to attend a race their one day.

            <p>
                When I was young, my family and I went on various holidays to Ski resorts in France and Austria, notably Alpe D'Huez.
                I am able to Ski well up to Black runs when I was around 14/15 Years Old. <br><br>
                After a few years break (due to Covid), a recent trip to Austria's Obertauern (as shown in the photo) allowed me to learn Snowboarding as well, which I now prefer.
                And after a a few days training I elevated my skills for solo runs.<br><br>
                In the future, I wish to improve my skills in Snowboarding to achieve new techniques and tricks and to try snow parks too, with an eventual dream to ski in Japan.

            <p>
                Throughout my childhood, I have often taken part in different sports including Tennis, Snowsports, and Hockey. <br><br>
                During my first year of University I joined the campus gym and started to build muscle, and eventually, in my second year
                joined the NTU Powerlifting Society for my final two years. Now, after a 3 month haitus due to a broken ankle, I have started to regain my
                skills and strength in the sport, with more of a focus on bodybuilding now.

            <p>
                During my earlier school years I took on Guitar lessons with a focus on Acoustic. After a break for a few years for exams and other interests,
                I purchased an electric guitar and started relearning and regaining my skills in the instrument.<br><br>
                My taste in music are often varied from Indie such as Two Door Cinema Club and The Royston Club to Rock such as Oasis and Queen to my favourites Laufey and Beabadoobee.
                I have attended gigs and concerts including Oasis's 2025 Tour to Piri and Maisi and varying tribute acts.
